# Installing Nokogiri

Because Nokogiri needs to be [compiled][] and [dynamically linked][]
against both [libxml2][] and [libxslt][], it has gained a
reputation for being complicated to install.

  [compiled]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler
  [dynamically linked]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_linker
  [libxml2]: http://xmlsoft.org/index.html
  [libxslt]: http://xmlsoft.org/xslt/

Let's wrassle this little myth to the ground, shall we?

## Ubuntu / Debian

Ubuntu doesn't come with the Ruby development packages that are
required for building gems with C extensions. Here are the commands to
install everything you might need:

    # ruby developer packages
    sudo apt-get install ruby1.8-dev ruby1.8 ri1.8 rdoc1.8 irb1.8
    sudo apt-get install libreadline-ruby1.8 libruby1.8 libopenssl-ruby

    # nokogiri requirements
    sudo apt-get install libxslt-dev libxml2-dev
    sudo gem install nokogiri

Although, if you're using Hardy (8.04) or earlier, you'll need to install slightly different packages:

    # nokogiri requirements for Hardy (8.04) and earlier
    sudo apt-get install libxslt1-dev libxml2-dev

As [John Barnette once said][package-management], "Isn't package management convenient? :)"

## Mac OS X

Please note that Leopard comes bundled with libxml 2.6.16. Someone in
Cupertino MUST be having some fun at our expense, because this is
clearly somebody's idea of a bad joke. 2.6.16 was [released Nov
2004][] and is really quite buggy. We here at Nokogiri HQ advise
*strongly* that you [do not use this version][].

  [released Nov 2004]: http://mail.gnome.org/archives/xml/2004-November/msg00074.html
  [do not use this version]: http://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/blob/master/lib/nokogiri/version_warning.rb#L2

Sensibly, Snow Leopard comes packaged with libxml 2.7.3, but you're
probably using either macports or homebrew to manage your dev
packages, so Read On, True Believer!

### macports

    sudo port install libxml2 libxslt
    sudo gem install nokogiri

And if you have problems, try:

    sudo port upgrade outdated

### homebrew 0.9

Apparently some people have had problems getting libiconv to install
under homebrew 0.9 (see [issue #442](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/442)).
Here's what reportedly works:

    brew install libxml2 libxslt wget
    
Then install libiconv from source:

    wget http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/libiconv/libiconv-1.13.1.tar.gz
    tar xvfz libiconv-1.13.1.tar.gz
    cd libiconv-1.13.1
    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/libiconv/1.13.1
    make
    sudo make install

If using Mountain Lion with Homebrew 0.9, it's been [reported](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/442#issuecomment-7978408) that you may also need to use gcc 4.2:
    sudo ln -s /usr/bin/gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.2
    
Then (finally) install nokogiri:

    gem install nokogiri -- --with-xml2-include=/usr/local/Cellar/libxml2/2.7.8/include/libxml2 \
                            --with-xml2-lib=/usr/local/Cellar/libxml2/2.7.8/lib \
                            --with-xslt-dir=/usr/local/Cellar/libxslt/1.1.26 \
                            --with-iconv-include=/usr/local/Cellar/libiconv/1.13.1/include \
                            --with-iconv-lib=/usr/local/Cellar/libiconv/1.13.1/lib

Well played, homebrew. That certainly was "the easiest and most
flexible way to install the UNIX tools Apple didn't include with OS
X." </sarcasm>


### homebrew 0.8

    brew install libxml2 libxslt libiconv
    brew link libxml2 libxslt libiconv
    gem install nokogiri
    
## homebrew 0.7

    # the rest of this snippet assumes installation of libxml 2.7.7. YMMV.
    brew install libxml2
    brew link libxml2
    
    # install libxslt from source
    wget ftp://xmlsoft.org/libxml2/libxslt-1.1.26.tar.gz
    tar -zxvf libxslt-1.1.26.tar.gz
    cd libxslt-1.1.26
    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/libxslt/1.1.26 \
                --with-libxml-prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/libxml2/2.7.7
    make
    sudo make install
    
    gem install nokogiri -- --with-xslt-dir=/usr/local/Cellar/libxslt/1.1.26


## Red Hat / CentOS

The easiest way to get Nokogiri installed on CentOS and RHEL seems to be the
[EPEL][] repository which contains a prebuilt nokogiri package. To use it,
install the appropriate [epel-release][] package for your OS, then run:

    sudo yum install -y rubygem-nokogiri

  [EPEL]: http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL
  [epel-release]: http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL#How_can_I_use_these_extra_packages.3F

To install using gem install is somewhat more complicated because of the age of
the packages available from the central repositories. If you have rubygems
installed, you may be able to install nokogiri via `gem install`. If you run
intro problems, try installing these packages as well.

    sudo yum install -y gcc ruby-devel libxml2 libxml2-devel libxslt libxslt-devel

CentOS 5 (and RHEL5) come installed with libxml 2.6.26 which, while not as
offensively out-of-date as Mac Leopard, is still pretty damn old ([released
June 2006][]) and has [known][] [issues][].

If you're affected by any known bugs or are seeing odd behavior, you
may want to consider uninstalling the RPMs for libxml2 and libxslt,
and building them from source.

  [released June 2006]: http://mail.gnome.org/archives/xml/2006-June/msg00043.html
  [known]: http://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues#issue/243
  [issues]: http://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues#issue/122

 1. `sudo yum remove -y libxml2-devel libxslt-devel`
 2. download the most recent libxml2 and libxslt from [ftp://xmlsoft.org/libxml2/](ftp://xmlsoft.org/libxml2/)
 3. `./configure ; make ; sudo make install`

Then install nokogiri specifying the libxml2 and libxslt install directories:

    sudo gem install nokogiri -- --with-xml2-lib=/usr/local/lib \
                                 --with-xml2-include=/usr/local/include/libxml2 \
                                 --with-xslt-lib=/usr/local/lib \
                                 --with-xslt-include=/usr/local/include

(Note that, by default, libxslt header files are installed into the
root include directory, but libxml2 header files are installed into a
subdirectory thereof named `libxml2`.)

Or, you know, whatever directories into which you installed libxml and
libxslt. Good luck.

## Nonstandard libxml2 / libxslt installations

If you've got libxml2 and/or libxslt installed in a nonstandard place
(read as "not /opt/local, /usr/local, /usr or the standard Ruby
directories"), you can use command-line parameters to the `gem
install` command to grease the wheels:

    gem install nokogiri -- --with-xml2-dir=/home/joe/builds \
                            --with-xslt-dir=/home/joe/builds

Or, you can specify include and library directories separately:

    gem install nokogiri -- --with-xml2-lib=/home/joe/builds/lib \
                            --with-xml2-include=/home/joe/builds/include/libxml2 \
                            --with-xslt-lib=/home/joe/builds/lib \
                            --with-xslt-include=/home/joe/builds/include

Note that, by default, libxslt header files are installed into the
root include directory, but libxml2 header files are installed into a
subdirectory thereof named `libxml2`.

## Windows

Luckily for you, building on Windows is so difficult that we've done
it for you: Nokogiri comes bundled with all the DLLs you need to be
NOKOGIRIFIED!

    gem install nokogiri
